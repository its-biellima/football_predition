# football_predition
This Python desktop app predicts football match outcomes based on team performance. Users enter stats (wins, draws, goals) for two teams, and the app calculates win probabilities and score predictions using the Poisson distribution. It's designed for easy use with a simple Tkinter interface. Perfect for sports analysis!

# Football Match Prediction App using Tkinter

## Overview

This Python desktop application predicts football match outcomes based on recent team performance statistics. Built with the Tkinter library, it allows users to input essential metrics for two football teams and provides predictions on win probabilities and expected scores.

## Features

- **Win Probability Calculation**: Computes the likelihood of each team winning or drawing based on performance data.
- **Score Prediction**: Utilizes the Poisson distribution to generate realistic score forecasts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and clean Tkinter interface for easy data entry and prediction display.
- **Reset Functionality**: Clear input fields for new predictions without restarting the app.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/football-match-prediction-tkinter.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd football-match-prediction-tkinter

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py

The application window will open, allowing you to enter team data and receive predictions.

## Technologies Used
   - Python
   - Tkinter for the graphical user interface
   - SciPy for Poisson distribution calculations

## How It Works
Enter team statistics (wins, draws, losses, goals scored, and goals conceded) in the input fields.
The app calculates the expected goals using the Poisson distribution and displays a score prediction.
Win probabilities for each team and the likelihood of a draw are also shown.

## Future Enhancements
Advanced Prediction Models: Implement machine learning techniques for improved accuracy.
Data Integration: Enable fetching historical performance data from online sources.
